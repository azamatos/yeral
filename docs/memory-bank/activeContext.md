# Active context

_Last updated: 2026-10-18_

## Current focus

**Strategy reset (2026-10-17, [ADR 0021](../decisions/0021-product-book-first.md)): the product book comes first.**
All design and coding work is paused until [`docs/product/`](../product/README.md) describes the whole product (vision,
norms, roles, rules, limits, MVP scope, every flow, notifications) with no open question. Then the full design, then
components in Storybook, then code. The owner reads and answers on the book's page
(https://claude.ai/artifact/LY9U6jrQRo3MfoHTg3JpyN); Claude writes the answers back into the book. Claude Code writes
every prompt for Claude Design; the owner pastes it; Claude Code checks the result on the canvas.

Where things stand: M0–M2 are merged and released as tags (#20, 2026-10-16): monorepo and CI, `@yeral/ui` (38
components), domain, contract, sdk, an api for every client screen on Postgres (not deployed). yeral.app still serves
`apps/legacy`. **Design export v0.5** (round 6 parts A and B, 16–17.10.2026, incl. `ROUND6-ANSWERS.md`) is committed
with the book (#27; `--ring-selected` mapped in the `@yeral/ui` theme); the book uses it as its newest design source.
The version PR #26
(`@yeral/lib@0.2.0`, `@yeral/api@0.1.1`, staging removed) is open and waits for the owner.

## Owner's direction

- 2026-10-13: infrastructure first; Cloudflare now, own server (Docker + nginx, Cloudflare for DNS) later; name/domain in
  config; repo public until ready; design system with Storybook and tests; run 2–3 agents in parallel later.
- 2026-10-14: follow the design's site map (marketplace on yeral.app, no landing app); remove the old mobile designs
  entirely ("we have a new design and our own logic"); maps = MapLibre + OpenFreeMap.
- 2026-10-14 (business design round 4, "decided 14.10.2026"): manual confirmation is the default, a business may switch on
  instant confirmation; requests expire after the business's hold time (default 30 min) with 3 alternative times. This
  replaces the morning's "every booking by hand, no instant setting".
- 2026-10-16: review every PR before merging (the agent merges after review and green CI).
- 2026-10-16: Ýeral is free for now (no plans, no commission); no staging, only local and production (ADR 0020); don't
  build the new yeral.app until the design is clarified and exported again (v0.5).
- 2026-10-17: stop everything and reorganise: first document the whole product (ideas, norms, rules, roles, limits,
  features, MVP in and out, every flow, with visuals) until no question is left; then the full design and
  components/Storybook; then code. Claude Code writes the prompts for Claude Design, the owner pastes them, Claude Code
  reads the canvas to check the result (ADR 0021).
- 2026-10-18: a shared decision room (first a claude.ai page "Karar", then an own app) was considered and dropped: the
  repo stays the record agents read, the product book page stays where the owner answers, and Claude syncs the answers.
  Build an own decisions app only when a second person decides regularly or syncing becomes a bottleneck. Next: the
  owner answers every book question; then an exact plan for yeral.app, the business app, the CMS and the backend,
  including when and what server to buy.
- 2026-10-18 (book answers): Ýeral isn't a Turkmen-only platform: it's built in English, and each country it launches
  in adds its own languages and settings (Turkmenistan first: Turkmen, Russian); ADR 0022. One launch with the client
  site, the business app and the CMS; the team adds the first businesses in the CMS; Ýeral on yeral.app; no average
  bill; businesses may be open past midnight and options stay flexible; the city is a choice (book Q-001–Q-003,
  Q-100–Q-109).

## Open questions

Product questions now live in **`docs/product/questions.md`**, one ID each (ADR 0021); answer them on the book's page.
Where the old questions went (2026-10-17):

| Old # | Question | Now |
|---|---|---|
| 16, 18 | Moving tables/classes; the round-6 logic gaps | answered by design v0.5 (`docs/design/ROUND6-ANSWERS.md`) |
| 17 | Font sizes 28 / 24 / 80; open past midnight | font sizes: keep the code's mapping (v0.5, H); past midnight: feature F-109 in chapter 6 |
| 1 | Checkout / POS; table/class setup wizard | features F-221 and F-116 in chapter 6; Q-030 |
| 2 | CMS design | Q-010, Q-011, Q-012 |
| 4 | Average bills; store badges | Q-103; feature F-004 |
| 5 | Native copy review | Q-101 |
| 6 | SMS provider and sender name | Q-109; chapter 8 (notifications) |
| 7 | Final name and domain | Q-003 |
| 10 | Real business photos and texts | Q-002 |

## Next steps

1. The owner reads the product book page and answers its questions; Claude writes each answer into `docs/product/`
   (chapters, `questions.md`, chapter 9) and republishes the page.
2. When chapters close: Claude writes the Claude Design prompts for what's undrawn or changed (chapter 6 lists design
   fixes already found); the owner pastes them; Claude checks the canvas.
3. With the answers: an exact plan for yeral.app, the business app, the CMS and the backend, with hosting (Q-032,
   Q-037: Turkmen law may require personal data stored in Turkmenistan) and when to buy which server.
4. Then components in Storybook and code, re-planned from the book's scope chapter (M3/M5 order is open: question Q-001).
   The "Code differs" lines across the book list what built code must change.
